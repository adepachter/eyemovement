# Eye Movement Exercise 

This exercise made us make some irises follow the cursor of your computermouse. We were given the assignment to actually program the second eye, which was pretty difficult, since the first one was moving already.


### How to run

- Download or clone repository on your computer,
- Open index.html with your browser (preferably Google Chrome),
- Enjoy!


### Future improvements

Maybe we can use these eyes in a future project, but else there is nothing much I could do for these fella's!
